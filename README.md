Chrome-S1Demo
=============

Extension for Chrome that opens Salesforce1 into an iPhone shaped window, based on the current instance.

*To Install*
Just download the CRX file and double click that.  Chrome should install after.  If that fails due to security restrictions, you can load the S1Demo directory as an unpacked extension.  


*To Use*
If you are currently browsing a Salesforce url, you'll see a phone in the URL bar.  Click that and it will open an iPhone shaped window to one/one.app.
